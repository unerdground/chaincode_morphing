## Overwiev
Given 2 black-and-white images, containing closed 4-oriented shapes. Algorithm calculates chaincode sequences for both shapes and calculates intermediate shape sequences based on edit distance (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) with amount of steps set by user, then draws it into images.

## Issues
Final version of this project was permanently lost, so current one is not in a working state and can be used for source code samples only.
